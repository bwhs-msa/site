The Briar Woods MSA raises money for a charitable cause that is chosen at the beginning of every new school year. The Briar Woods MSA hopes to donate a generous portion of its funds to the <a href="http://www.faithus.org/" target="blank">Foundation for Appropriate and Immediate Temporary Help (FAITH)</a>, a local social services organization dedicated to "Building Stronger and Kinder Communities". 
One of the biggest ways that the MSA supports their cause is by hosting a yearly fundraising dinner and donating the funds. In spring of the 2017-2018 academic year, the Briar Woods MSA worked independently to host the dinner, but have also worked with other MSAs in the region to host Inter-MSA banquets in the past. The Briar Woods MSA has previously raised money for <a href="http://www.kindnessbeyondborders.com/" target="blank">Kindness and Care Beyond Borders</a> and the <a href="http://wish.org/" target="blank">Make A Wish Foundation</a>.
